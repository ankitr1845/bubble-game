This project is a fun web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to match the target number by clicking on the correct bubble before the timer runs out. It's a fun and engaging way to test your speed and accuracy.
When the game starts, a target number (labeled as "Hit") is displayed at the top. Below it, multiple bubbles containing random numbers appear on the screen. Your task is to find and click the bubble that matches the target number. Each correct click increases your score by 10 points, and a new target number is generated. The game continues until the timer reaches zero.
